# minecraft-core

Minecraft-Core is a lightweight Minecraft plugin API designed to help developers create structured plugins. Included are an annotation based modular plugin system with built-in annotation based modular commands, and many services that simplify and abstract actions, so they can be used in common code.

Also, through Hibernate, this framework also offers the possibility of uncomplicated data processing through various actions and classes.


### Status: Work in Progress
Through regular updates and extensions, Minecraft Core is constantly kept up to date. Currently, fundamental content is programmed and added over time.
